About
I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. My research focuses on developing machine learning systems for real-world data and use cases.![Uploading image.png…]()
 This includes remote sensing and spatial datasets, fairness (particularly w.r.t. geographic bias), scientific discovery and exploration, agriculture and food security, and other topics. I am the AI/Machine Learning Lead for NASA Harvest and NASA Acres as well as Center Faculty for the ASU Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science (GDCS). I was recognized on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in Science in 2021. I also write and speak about challenges for developing AI/ML applications for real world problems, such as in this recent article in MIT Technology Review.
